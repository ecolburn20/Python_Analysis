## Python Analysis
This project contains analysis done on two different data sets. The first data set is sample budget data. Using python, the total amount
of profits for the company, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits were calculated among other things. For the
second data set, sample election data was used. Analysis was done to see how many total votes there were, the percentage of votes
received by each canidate, and the overall winner of the election.
